## 1. ✅ Robust Keyword Extraction

**Files Modified:** `src/components/EnhancedIdeaPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced `extractKeywordsFromText()` function with:
  - Synonym mapping for all keyword types (location, budget, category, industry, domain, timeline, target, scalability, validation, metrics)
  - Support for "key: value" format detection
  - Multiple trigger words per keyword type
  - Better heuristics for location (title-cased words after prepositions)
  - Currency and range detection for budget
  - Duration and deadline detection for timeline
  - Handles free-form user input more robustly

**Example:**
- "We're based in San Francisco" → detects "San Francisco" as location
